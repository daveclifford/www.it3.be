# IT3 Consultants Support Services for Rear

## What is Relax-and-Recover (Rear)?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/logo/rear_logo_100.png" width="51" height="58" border="0" align="left" alt="Rear logo" />
Rear stands for <strong>Re</strong>lax <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>r</strong>ecover and is a Linux Disaster Recovery framework written in bash shell.

The code is completely free and is published with the GNU Public Licence version 2.

When we said rear is a disaster recovery framework we meant each module is small and has its own specific goal. Rear creates an iso image to boot from in case of disaster and the backup can be stores practically anywhere (NFS, CIFS, USB disks, remote tape devices). Rear is also capable to integrate with open source backup solutions such as Bacula, Bareos and also with commercial backup solutions such as Tivoli, NetBackup, EMC NetWorker and Data Protector.
IT3 Consultants is an official RedHat partner and you will find a web page on rear on their [partner website](http://redhat.force.com/finder/PFPartnerDetail?id=0016000000M8PW4AAN)
