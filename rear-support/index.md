# IT3 Consultants Support Services for Rear

## What is Relax-and-Recover (Rear)?

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/logo/rear_logo_100.png" width="51" height="58" border="0" align="left" alt="Rear logo" />
Rear stands for <strong>Re</strong>lax <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>r</strong>ecover and is a Linux Disaster Recovery framework written in bash shell.

The code is completely free and is published with the GNU Public Licence version 2.

When we said rear is a disaster recovery framework we meant each module is small and has its own specific goal. Rear creates an iso image to boot from in case of disaster and the backup can be stores practically anywhere (NFS, CIFS, USB disks, remote tape devices). Rear is also capable to integrate with open source backup solutions such as Bacula, Bareos and also with commercial backup solutions such as Tivoli, NetBackup, EMC NetWorker and Data Protector.
IT3 Consultants is an official RedHat partner and you will find a web page on rear on their [partner website](http://redhat.force.com/finder/PFPartnerDetail?id=0016000000M8PW4AAN)

We can imagine this may sound a bit overwhelming to you, but we can help you out with the following offerings:

## Relax-and-Recover (Rear) Software Subscriptions

We offer software subscriptions so we are able to spend time on continous improvements of the code base and to be able to build automated test environments. As you are probably aware this cost a lot of money (and we invested a lot already) and time which we cannot spend on other (paid) projects. If you like rear and want us to keep up doing the good work then we would appreciate you go for a software subscription. We will mail you an invoice which acts as a proof for a valid software subscription.

To make you life easy we have foreseen the following options:
