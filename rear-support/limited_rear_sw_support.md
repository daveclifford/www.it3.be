Limited <strong>Re</strong>lax <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>r</strong>ecover (rear) Software Support contract is a software support contract for Linux systems. It is the simplest and easiest way to buy support from IT3 Consultants and it foresees in the following:


* A rear software subscription is included (REAR-1) - one single client using rear
* Software contract is valid for <b>one (1) year</b> starting on the day the support fees are collected
* Customers should use their [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to log an issue
* Customers submit an issue at [GitHub issues page of rear](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)
* Customers may submit an issue any time of the day (24 hours). However, if GitHub is down for maintenance (or unavailable) please be patient and try to submit later again
* Submit long log files is possible via [Gists](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/), but submit the link to it in the issue of your request
* We will commence work on resolving the deficiency within three (3) business days of notification and will engage staff during working hours until an acceptable resolution is achieved (legal holidays and week-ends do not count)
* Limited Rear Software Support contracts do not use live (Skype) Phone calls or private e-mail conversations, only GitHub conversations are used (as we get an automated notification from GitHub)
* Customers may prepare [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (we will code review and give you feedback)
* Customers may submit as many issues during the period of the contract. However, only 3 incidents are covered by this support contract. This means issue number 4 and higher will be treated as *free* of charge issues, whereby the support contract rules as not valid anymore. With other words, they will get the same treatment as free issues (no guarantees of support nor fix).

Price for one (1) Limited Rear Software Support contract is 100,00 Euro (without taxes, VAT)
