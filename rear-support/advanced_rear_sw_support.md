Advanced <strong>Re</strong>lax <strong>a</strong>nd <strong>r</strong>ecover (rear) Software Support contract is a software support contract for Linux systems. It is the simplest and easiest way to buy support from IT3 Consultants and it foresees in the following:


* A rear software subscription is included (REAR-10) - up to 10 clients using rear are covered
* Software contract is valid for <b>one (1) year</b> starting on the day the support fees are collected
* Customers may use their [GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) to log an issue, but mailing or phoning us is also allowed (only authorized persons allowed)
* Customers submit an issue at [GitHub issues page of rear](https://github.com/rear/rear/issues)
* Customers may submit an issue any time of the day (24 hours). However, if GitHub is down for maintenance (or unavailable) please be patient and try to submit later again
* Submit long log files is possible via [Gists](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-gists/), but submit the link to it in the issue of your request
* We will commence work on resolving the deficiency on the business day of notification and will engage staff during working hours until an acceptable resolution is achieved (legal holidays and week-ends do not count)
* Advanced Rear Software Support contracts may use live (Skype) Phone calls or private e-mail conversations, however GitHub conversations are also allowed of course
* Customers may prepare [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) (we will code review and give you feedback)
* Customers may submit as many issues during the period of the contract. However, only 30 incidents are covered by this support contract. This means issue number 31 and higher will be treated as *free* of charge issues, whereby the support contract rules as not valid anymore. With other words, they will get the same treatment as free issues (no guarantees of support nor fix).

Price for one (1) Advanced Rear Software Support contract is 750,00 Euro (without taxes, VAT)
