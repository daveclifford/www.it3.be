##  Make CD-ROM Recovery (mkCDrec) project

The Open Source project "[Make CD-ROM Recovery](http://mkcdrec.sourceforge.net)" or abbreviated mkCDrec was launched for the first time in November 2000. Thousands of customers are using mkCDrec to create a disaster recovery image of their Linux systems.

IT3 Consultants used to support this Open Source project free of charge via Sourceforge tracker web page, but we stopped this because we wanted to put our energy into new projects like [Relax-and-Recover (rear)]({{ site.url }}/company/rear-support.html), which is the successor of mkCDrec anyway.

However, we still offer the opportunity to buy support from us directly. Please call or mail us for more information. We are glad to assist you in migration projects from mkcdrec to rear.
