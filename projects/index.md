# IT3 Consultants Projects

What kind of projects are we involved in? In short for customer who pay for it and open source projects. It is clear that on projects done for customers we cannot communicate much without their approval.

On Open Source projects we give more details.

## Relax-and-Recover (rear)

<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/logo/rear_logo_100.png" width="30" height="30" alt="Rear logo">

[Relax-and-Recover]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear.html) is an open source Disaster Recovery tool handling bare metal restores in an automated way (aw much as possible). Making snapshot of your system can be done *on-line* and send over to remote storage such as NAS, CIFS, USB, Network,...

## Config To HTML (cfg2html)

[Cfg2html]({{ site.url }}/projects/cfg2html.html) is a little utility to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up to an ASCII file and HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful in disaster recovery situations.

## Ad-hoc Copy and Run (adhocr)

[adhocr]({{ site.url }}/projects/adhocr.html) is a little `expect` utility to parallelize execution of commands on lots of systems.
