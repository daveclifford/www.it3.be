# IT3 Consultants Projects

What kind of projects are we involved in? In short for customer who pay for it and open source projects. It is clear that on projects done for customers we cannot communicate much without their approval.

On Open Source projects we give more details.

## Relax-and-Recover (Rea)

[Relax-and-Recover]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear.html) is an open source Disaster Recovery tool handling bare metal restores in an automated way (as much as possible). Making snapshots of your system can be done *on-line* and send over to remote storage such as NAS, CIFS, USB, Network,...

## Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) AUtomated Testing

[Relax-and-Recover Automated Testing ]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear-automated-testing.md) is an open source sub-project of ReaR dedicated to ReaR testing fully automated. This project is sponsored by customers who subscribed to one of our [ReaR Support Services]({{ site.url }}/rear-support/).

[Upgrade-UX]({{ site.url }}/projects/upgrade-ux.html) is an Open Source framework designed to assist the UNIX system engineer in patching or upgrading systems in a consistent and repeatable way with evidence before and after the running upgrade-ux.


## Config To HTML (cfg2html)

[Cfg2html]({{ site.url }}/projects/cfg2html.html) is a little utility to collect the necessary system configuration files and system set-up to an ASCII file and HTML file. Simple to use and very helpful in disaster recovery situations.


## Ad-hoc Copy and Run (adhocr)

[adhocr]({{ site.url }}/projects/adhocr.html) is a little `expect` utility to parallelize execution of commands on lots of systems.

## Wbemextras

[wbemextras]({{ site.url }}/projects/wbemextras.html) contains some scripts to assist in HP SIM installation and configuration on HP-UX

## Make CD-ROM Recovery (mkcdrec)

[mkCDrec]({{ site.url }}/projects/mkcdrec.html) is the predecessor project of ReaR and has been phased out in favour of [ReaR]({{ site.url }}/projects/rear.html). Getting support is still possible, but no longer free of charge.
