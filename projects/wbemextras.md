## wbemextras project

[wbemextras](http://www.cfg2html.com/) contains a few scripts written in Korn shell to assist you in installing, upgrading HP-SIM related software on HP-UX systems. A SIM Health Check script is also foreseen to inspect the status of the software and some other basic checks including sending a test event to HP Support Center. An HTML file will also be included with more information on the pre-requisites and how to use these scripts.

The various stable releases are available from the [wbemextras download page]({{ site.url }}/projects/wbemextras/).
