## Ad-hoc Copy and Run (adhocr) Project

In large company environments they use a central directory systems to authenticate users against when users login onto a Linux/Unix or Windows box. Most likely the central directory service will be based on LDAP or Active Directory (of Microsoft). On the Unix boxes there is then a client install that communicates with this central directory service. It is mainly in such environments that adhocr is an useful and powerful tool.
